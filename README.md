# Interactive Koch Curve Generator
## Published at: [Take me to the web page!](https://cevataykans.github.io/interactive-koch-curve/)
### About
>  This small project is about displaying Koch curves using WebGL. The user draws an arbitrary convex shape and applies the Koch curve to the edges. This way, the new shape must be generated and rendered using WebGL. The purpose of this project is to study the fundamentals of WebGL. This project enabled me to understand how data is sent to the GPU using buffers and how the points are rendered.

## Features
* Koch curve algorithm up to 7 iterations.
* Fully customizable background / curve color.
* Saving/loading system. You can save your piece of art and reload it later.
* Simple UI.
* Fault tolerance.

## How to Use
	•	Click on the canvas to draw an arbitrary convex shape.
	•	Click until the shape is complete.
	•	When the shape is drawn, you can no longer manipulate it.
	•	If you would like to draw another shape, clear it.
	•	If you do not want to lose the shape, save it before clearing.
	•	Set the number of iterations after the shape is drawn.
	•	Click on the apply rule button.
	•	You can play with the iteration count and re-apply it any time to observe differences.
	•	At any time you can change background and curve color by clicking on respective color icons.
	•	You can load your favorite saved shapes from your device.
